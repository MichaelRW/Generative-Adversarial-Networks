This code is for a workshop on Generative Adversairal Networks (GANs) presented by Aggregate Intellect Inc.

The workshop explored the idea of generating information using GANs and examined implementations of a basic GAN, a deep convolutional GAN,
and a Cycle GAN.  This material was presented by Andrew B. Martin from Looka (https://looka.com/).
